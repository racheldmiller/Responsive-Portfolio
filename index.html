                    <p>Hello! My name is Rachel Miller! I grew up in the heart of downtown San Francisco, and I'm proud to be an SF native.
                    (As much as I'd like to experience living elsewhere, I wouldn't know where exactly.) I graduated from UC Berkeley
                    with a BA in English. I was persuaded to persue that major because of its practicality and flexibility. The only issue is, because 
                    I've always had so many interests, I struggled with focusing on what I want to do with my life.</p>
                    <p>I am attending UC Berkeley's Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp because I think it'd help me in my current role, but ultimately, 
                    I'm interested in a career change. I love how rewarding coding is. Not only does it allow you to explore your creativity, it also 
                    fosters a collaborative environment and challenges your problem-solving skills.</p>
                    <p>Let's see... some fun facts about myself: I enjoy connecting with people (preferably 1x1) over boba or coffee, walking, and terrible puns. I've never seen
                    snow in-person and I don't know how to ride a bike. Hopefully 2019 will be the year to change that. Lastly, I'm an ambivert, and I recently learned
                    my enneagram is Type 2.</p>
